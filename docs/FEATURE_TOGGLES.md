# Garble feature toggles

This reference consolidates every command-line flag and environment variable that flips behaviour inside Garble. It reflects the state of `master` as of October 2025 and was assembled by walking the entire repository.

## CLI flags

| Flag | Values / type | Default | Controls | Notes & interactions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `-literals` | boolean | `false` | Enables literal obfuscation (strings, numbers, eligible string constants, `-ldflags -X` injections) via `internal/literals`. | Performs a pre-pass that rewrites safe `const` strings into vars; affects build outputs and cache keys. No environment alias. |
| `-tiny` | boolean | `false` | Optimises for binary size at the cost of reversibility. | Propagates as `GARBLE_LINK_TINY=true` for the patched linker. Combines with `-reversible` but favours smaller binaries. |
| `-debug` | boolean | `false` | Emits verbose obfuscation logs to stderr. | Does not change build artefacts; skipped in build cache keys. |
| `-debugdir` | string (path) | unset | Writes obfuscated Go sources to the given directory. | Directory is recreated on each build (sentinel `.garble-debugdir`). Forces `go` to rebuild dependencies (`-a`). |
| `-seed` | base64 string or `random` | unset | Supplies deterministic entropy for name hashing, literal mangling, and cache encryption. | When `random`, a fresh 32-byte seed is generated and printed to stderr. Without a seed Garble derives entropy solely from the build nonce. |
| `-reversible` | boolean | `false` | Keeps enough metadata to support `garble reverse` and easier debugging. | Weakens obfuscation. Propagated to the linker as `GARBLE_LINK_REVERSIBLE=true`. |
| `-controlflow` | enum: `off`, `directives`, `auto`, `all` | `off` | Selects the scope for control-flow obfuscation transforms. | CLI value wins over `GARBLE_CONTROLFLOW`. `auto` respects `//garble:nocontrolflow` directives and skips unsafe SSA shapes. |
| `-no-cache-encrypt` | boolean (presence flag) | `false` | Disables ASCON encryption of Garble's build cache. | Encryption is on by default when both this flag is absent *and* a seed is available. |

### Flag interactions worth noting

- **Cache encryption** only activates when a seed is present (via `-seed` or inherited from the parent process). `-no-cache-encrypt` turns it off even with a seed.
- **Control-flow scope** can also be set through `GARBLE_CONTROLFLOW`; the CLI flag always takes precedence.
- **Reproducible builds** typically combine `-seed=<known>` with `GARBLE_BUILD_NONCE=<known>` and omit `-no-cache-encrypt` so cache entries stay encrypted with the supplied seed.

## Environment variables (regular build usage)

| Variable | Default | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GOGARBLE` | `*` (obfuscate every package) | Selects which import paths Garble obfuscates. Accepts the same pattern syntax as Go's module matching. | Used in build hashing. Example: `GOGARBLE=./cmd/foo,...` to scope obfuscation. |
| `GARBLE_CONTROLFLOW` | unset → behaves like `off` | Provides the same values as the `-controlflow` flag (`off`, `directives`, `auto`, `all`). | Only read when the CLI flag is absent. |
| `GARBLE_BUILD_NONCE` | Random 32-byte value generated per build | Injects a deterministic 32-byte nonce (base64 *without* padding) to stabilise hashes across builds. | When unset, Garble draws a cryptographically random nonce and prints `-nonce chosen at random` when randomness was used. |
| `GARBLE_CACHE` | `${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/garble` (or platform equivalent) | Overrides the on-disk cache root Garble uses for build metadata and patched toolchain artifacts. | Helpful for sandboxing or sharing caches across CI jobs. |
| `GARBLE_WRITE_CPUPROFILES` | unset | When set to a directory, collects a CPU profile `garble-cpu-*.pprof` for the top-level Garble process. | Directory must exist; profile is closed automatically on exit. |
| `GARBLE_WRITE_MEMPROFILES` | unset | Writes a heap profile `garble-mem-*.pprof` into the specified directory just before exit. | Triggers a `runtime.GC()` to capture fresh statistics. |
| `GARBLE_WRITE_ALLOCS` | unset → disabled | If set to `true`, prints total heap allocations (`garble allocs: <n>`) at exit. | Intended for instrumentation and regression tracking. |

## Environment variables managed internally

These are populated by Garble itself so that its `toolexec` subprocesses and the patched linker see consistent settings. They are documented here for completeness; end-users normally should not set them manually.

| Variable | Set by | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GARBLE_SHARED` | Top-level Garble process | Points child processes at the shared gob-encoded build state. | Cleared and deleted after the build. A pre-existing value allows nested invocations to reuse the same workspace. |
| `LINK_SEED` | Garble | Base64-encoded 32-byte Feistel seed used to encrypt runtime metadata (e.g. method tables). | Must be present; linker panics if missing. |
| `GARBLE_LINK_REVERSIBLE` | Garble | Communicates whether reversible mode is enabled. | Set to `true` when `-reversible`; otherwise `false`. |
| `GARBLE_LINK_TINY` | Garble | Communicates whether tiny binaries are requested. | Read by linker patches to strip additional metadata. |

## Developer/test harness variables

The repository also defines a handful of switches that assist automated testing or specialised builds. They do not normally affect production usage but are listed for completeness.

| Variable | Scope | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GARBLE_TEST_GOVERSION` | Test scripts (`testdata/script/goversion.txtar`) | Overrides the Go toolchain version that `main.go` compares against the build's recorded version. | Lets tests simulate running under mismatched toolchains. Not meant for CI/production builds. |
| `GARBLE_TEST_LITERALS_OBFUSCATOR_MAP` | Builds with the `garble_testing` tag | Provides a comma-separated mapping of package → obfuscator index so literal fuzz/bench harnesses can pick deterministic obfuscators. | Required when compiling the benchmarking helper under `scripts/bench_literals.go`. |
| `RUN_GARBLE_MAIN` | `bench_test.go` & `main_test.go` | Signals the integration tests to invoke the `garble` binary instead of stubbing commands. | Ignored outside the test harness. |
| `GARBLE_TEST_REVERSING` | `testdata/script/cgo.txtar` sample program | Toggles additional logging inside the fixture binary to exercise `garble reverse`. | Read by the sample program, not by Garble itself. |

## Flags Applied Automatically

Garble automatically applies the following flags to build commands. You **do not need** to specify them manually:

| Flag | Applied When | Purpose | Code Reference |
|------|--------------|---------|----------------|
| `-trimpath` | Always (all `go list/build` commands) | Strips filesystem paths from binaries. Garble extends this with `sharedTempDir` handling to prevent temporary directory leaks. | `cache_shared.go:290`, `transformer.go:76-82` |
| `-buildvcs=false` | Always | Omits VCS metadata (git commit hash, dirty state) from binaries. | `cache_shared.go:290` |
| `-ldflags="-w"` | Link phase only | Strips DWARF debugging information (file/line mappings, variable names). | `transformer.go:1328` |
| `-ldflags="-s"` | Link phase only | Strips symbol table and debug sections completely. | `transformer.go:1328` |
| `-buildid=""` | Link phase only | Removes Go build ID to prevent binary tracking across builds. | `transformer.go:1324` |
| `-X=runtime.buildVersion=unknown` | Link phase only | Replaces `runtime.Version()` output with "unknown" instead of "go1.X.Y". | `transformer.go:1322` |

**Important Notes:**
- These flags are **hardcoded** and cannot be overridden by user input.
- Manual specification (e.g., adding `-ldflags="-s -w"` yourself) is redundant and has no effect.
- `-trimpath` is extended by Garble's `alterTrimpath()` function to include temporary build directories.

## Quick precedence checklist

- CLI flags are parsed once at process startup; re-entrant invocations inherit state via `GARBLE_SHARED` and the cached seed/nonce.
- When both a CLI flag and an environment variable target the same feature, the CLI flag wins (`-controlflow` over `GARBLE_CONTROLFLOW`, `-seed` over any inherited entropy).
- Encryption and other security-sensitive features rely on both `-seed` and the build nonce; keep them aligned when creating reproducible yet hardened builds.
